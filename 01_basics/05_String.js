const name = "Anand";
const repocount = 50;

console.log(name+ repocount );// this is a old method so no recommended to use

console.log(` Hello my name is ${name} and my repo is ${repocount}`);//use of backtick is a standard way wher string interpolation comes into picture means we make place holders whatever value is stored in that i can access
